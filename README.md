The script created

1.	Import data from the "train" and "test" databases as well as generic labels
2.	Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
3.	Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
4. 	Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
5.	Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
6.	Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
7.	Print out a tidy database as output.txt file

The script must be launched with the command 

run.analysis()

from the prompt after having ensured that data folders "test" and "train" are included in the working directory.
